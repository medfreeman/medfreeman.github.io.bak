Hi there. Before having fun with Phenomic, be sure to read the documentationÂ :

* [How to setup a new project with Phenomic](https://phenomic.io/docs/setup/)
* [Getting Started with Phenomic](https://phenomic.io/docs/getting-started/)
* [Usage & APIs](https://phenomic.io/docs/usage/)
* [FAQ](https://phenomic.io/docs/faq/)

Also take a look to
[existing websites that use Phenomic](https://phenomic.io/showcase/),
some projects share their source code!

You may want to take a look to the [404.html](/404.html) and tweak the render.

If you want to adjust page layouts, directly adjust them in ``src/layouts/``.  
If you want to adjust small parts like header, footer, buttons, etc, you will
find those in ``src/components/``.  
For colors and common CSS variables, you will find stuff to adjust in ``postcss.plugins.js``.

_You feel like the base theme is not enough or you just saw something wrong?_
