Hi there. Before having fun with Phenomic, be sure to read the documentationÂ :

* [How to setup a new project with Phenomic](https://phenomic.io/docs/setup/)
* [Getting Started with Phenomic](https://phenomic.io/docs/getting-started/)
* [Usage & APIs](https://phenomic.io/docs/usage/)
* [FAQ](https://phenomic.io/docs/faq/)

Also take a look at
[existing websites that use Phenomic](https://phenomic.io/showcase/),
some projects share their source code!

You may want to take a look at the [404.html](/404.html) and tweak the render.

If you need to make adjustments, you can directly alter page layouts in
``src/layouts/``;
small things like the header, footer, buttons and so on can be changed in
``src/components/``;
and for colors and common CSS variables, you can modify ``postcss.config.js``.

_You feel like the base theme is not enough or you just saw something wrong?_
